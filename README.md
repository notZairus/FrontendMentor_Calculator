## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to use css custom properties. In my code about the themes, i found a better way to implement it but i got lazy and didnt do it. Also, i decided not to do it so i can track my progress on the time i did this project.

### Further Development

This still has bugs, one of them is the lack of restriction to input +, x, and / without any numbers before them.
I will fix that after my midterm examination.
